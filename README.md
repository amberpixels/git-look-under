# Git Look Around

> Lightning-fast command palette for GitHub repos, PRs, and issues.

A Chrome/Firefox extension that adds a command palette to GitHub so you can jump to repos, pull requests, and issues without losing your flow. It syncs your GitHub data in the background, shows rate-limit awareness, and stays out of the way until you hit the shortcut.

## What it does
- Toggle the overlay with `Cmd+Shift+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Linux/Windows) from any GitHub page.
- Fuzzy search across repos, PRs, and issues with a single input and ghost-text suggestions for the top hit.
- Filter to just your contributions or items you have visited; per-repo badges show PR/issue counts at a glance.
- Popup panel shows sync status, rate limits, and lets you reload or jump to options.

## Demo

## Why this palette?
- GitHub’s feature-preview Command Palette is heavier and broader; Git Look Around stays lightweight and focused on fast search + navigation.
- Everything is reactive: as soon as sync finishes, repo/PR/issue results update without reloading GitHub.
- Quick hop back to recent places (visited filter), inspired by the fast-switcher experience in modern IDEs.

## Download & Links

## Coming soon
- Firefox build: tested, release packaging in progress.

## Under the hood
- Built with Vue 3 + WXT; background workers index your GitHub repos, pull requests, and issues for fast local filtering.
- Content script mounts the command palette UI directly on GitHub; the popup detects the current repo and lets you force a sync if needed.
- Icons and branding come from the extension bundle; keep assets under `/git-look-around/` when updating this page.

## Development
- Requirements: Node 18.17+ (or 20+), pnpm 9+.
- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- Dev: `pnpm dev` (Chrome) or `pnpm dev:firefox`
- Build: `pnpm build` or `pnpm build:firefox`
